# 📌 Atliq Supply Chain Analysis  

## 📖 Overview  
Atliq Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer, is facing a **supply chain crisis**—key customers are unhappy, contracts are not getting renewed, and service levels have taken a hit. 📉 This project aims to **analyze and optimize Atliq Mart’s supply chain performance** using **Python, SQL, Tableau, and PowerPoint** to uncover key insights.  

## 🧼 Data Cleaning (Python)  
Before any analysis, the data needed some serious cleanup:  
- **Consolidated multiple datasets** (Customers, Products, Orders, Order Lines, Targets).  
- **Formatted date columns** for consistency 📅.  
- **Split product names** into meaningful attributes for better analysis 🔍.  
- **Renamed messy column names** for clarity.  
- **Exported the cleaned dataset** into an Excel file for seamless SQL analysis.  

## 🛢️ Data Analysis (SQL)  
After cleaning, **SQL was used to dive deep into supply chain metrics**:  
- **On-Time % (OT%)**: Orders delivered before the promised date.  
- **In-Full % (IF%)**: Orders delivered with the full quantity requested.  
- **On-Time In-Full % (OTIF%)**: The holy grail of supply chain efficiency.  
- **Line Fill Rate (LIFR) & Volume Fill Rate (VOFR)**: To check if products were delivered as expected.  
- **Customer-wise & Month-on-Month Trends**: Identified problem areas affecting service quality.  

## 📊 Dashboard (Tableau)  
The cleaned data was visualized using an **interactive Tableau dashboard** to track:  
- **Declining order trends** (March–August saw a drop of 300 orders 📉).  
- **Service level gaps** (OTIF % significantly below target 🚨).  
- **Top problematic customers** (Acclaimed Stores, Lotus Mart, Chiptec Stores).  
- **Key issues with perishable items** (Milk & Curd had the lowest OTIF % due to storage & supply problems).  

## 📑 Business Insights & Presentation (PowerPoint)  
All findings were consolidated into a **PowerPoint report**, highlighting:  
- Reasons for the **service decline & contract losses**.  
- **Supply chain inefficiencies** in fulfilling orders.  
- **Key improvement areas** for boosting OTIF % and customer retention.  

## 🚀 Conclusion  
This project provides a **data-driven approach** to diagnosing and improving Atliq Mart’s supply chain performance. With better **forecasting, logistics planning, and service tracking**, Atliq Mart can **regain customer trust and drive future growth**!
